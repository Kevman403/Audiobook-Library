The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator intones, \"No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's.\" <p> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first, the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity, even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100 feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. </p> <p>With horror, the narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much as corralled.</p>","title":"The War of the Worlds","titleShort":"The War of the Worlds"},{"added":46,"asin":"B017DPC65Q","authors":[{"name":"Paul Tassi","url":"B00GF2V55Q"}],"blurb":"The Earth lies in ruins in the aftermath of an extraterrestrial invasion, the land devastated by a desperate war with no winners between mankind....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51qjfMVYqZL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","fromPlusCatalog":true,"language":"English","length":"10h 32m","narrators":[{"name":"Victor Bevine"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B01976WLBS","authors":"Paul Tassi","cover":"516nmgF80JL","length":"12 hrs and 44 mins","narrators":"Victor Bevine","subHeading":"The Earthborn Trilogy, Book 2","title":"The Exiled Earthborn"},{"asin":"B01D0L2TEA","authors":"Paul Tassi","cover":"51vUVOd3G2L","length":"16 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Victor Bevine","subHeading":"The Earthborn Trilogy, Book 3","title":"The Sons of Sora"},{"asin":"B084WZ6H1C","authors":"Nathan Hystad, Jasper T.

Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors.

There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.</p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah.

What she uncovers will change everything. </p> <p>Total extinction is just on the horizon, but will the cure be worse than the virus? </p> <p><i>Extinction Edge</i> </p> <p>A new threat that will bring humanity to the edge of extinction. </p> <p>The dust from Dr. Kate Lovato's bioweapon has settled. Projections put death counts in the billions. Her weapon was supposed to be the endgame, but it turned a small percentage of those infected with the hemorrhage virus into something even worse. </p> <p>Survivors call them Variants. Irreversible epigenetic changes have transformed them into predators unlike any the human race has ever seen. And they are evolving. </p> <p>With the doomsday clock ticking, the fractured military plans Operation Liberty - a desperate mission designed to take back the cities and destroy the Variant threat. Master Sergeant Reed Beckham agrees to lead a strike team into New York City, but first he must return to Fort Bragg to search for the only family he has left. </p> <p>At Plum Island, Kate discovers Central Command may have considerably underestimated the Variant population in New York. As Operation Liberty draws closer, Kate warns Beckham that Team Ghost won't just face their deadliest adversary yet, they may be heading into a trap. </p> <p><i>Extinction Age</i> </p> <p>On the eve of extinction, all seems to be lost, but there is still one final hope. </p> <p>Operation Liberty has failed. Humans are losing the war. With no other option, General Kennor decides to pull back the troops and give science a second chance. </p> <p>Trapped in the extensive sewer system beneath New York, Master Sergeant Reed Beckham and the survivors of 1st Platoon must battle through the tunnels - where they make a grisly discovery in their attempt to escape. </p> <p>At Plum Island, Dr. Kate Lovato is working on a new bioweapon to destroy the Variants. But when a derelict Navy destroyer crashes into the Connecticut shoreline, she is forced to deal with a nightmare she thought had ended. </p> <p>As the doomsday clock ticks down and military bases fall across the country, the human race enters the age of extinction. </p>","title":"The Extinction Cycle Boxed Set: Extinction Horizon, Extinction Edge, and Extinction Age (The Extinction Cycle, Books 1 - 3)","titleShort":"The Extinction Cycle Boxed Set"},{"added":21,"asin":"B003T1LJ70","authors":[{"name":"Glen Cook","url":"B000AQ26ZQ"}],"blurb":"Some feel the Lady, newly risen from centuries in thrall, stands between humankind and evil.

The godly essence now residing within him offers power that could be used against the Fade - but with every death that feeds It, Cole risks losing a part of himself.

And in the frozen north, the legendary warrior Brodar Kayne fights a desperate battle for his people. He is running out of time: an ancient evil sealed beneath the mountains is about to break free, an evil that is older than humanity, older than the Fade, older even than the gods - and it will not stop until the entire world is drowned in blood. </p>","title":"Dead Man's Steel: The Grim Company, Book 3","titleShort":"Dead Man's Steel"},{"added":14,"asin":"B00XK3GO4U","authors":[{"name":"Luke Scull","url":"B00E7FSHMM"}],"blurb":"The adventure continues as the company - now broken - face new dangers on personal quests....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51+3B5+omWL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"17h 54m ","narrators":[{"name":"Gerard Doyle"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00VUS19W4","authors":"Peter Newman","cover":"51TWxPZ-YtL","length":"13 hrs and 24 mins","narrators":"Jot Davies","title":"The Vagrant"},{"asin":"B01GIRIFOQ","authors":"Mark Lawrence","cover":"514owCuB0mL","length":"18 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","title":"The Wheel of Osheim"},{"asin":"B008EX1UOK","authors":"Mark Lawrence","cover":"61v+PNB4BFL","length":"9 hrs and 19 mins","narrators":"James Clamp","title":"Prince of Thorns"},{"asin":"B00YGRB72S","authors":"Mark Lawrence","cover":"51aifa9nVnL","length":"19 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","title":"The Liar's Key"},{"asin":"000833143X","authors":"David Wragg","cover":"61rmk7SDGnL","length":"12 hrs and 9 mins","narrators":"Colin Mace","subHeading":"Articles of Faith, Book 1","title":"The Black Hawks"},{"asin":"B00KQ06SNW","authors":"Mark Lawrence","cover":"51ZU-mznvnL","length":"14 hrs and 38 mins","narrators":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","subHeading":"The Red Queen's War, Book 1","title":"Prince of Fools"},{"asin":"B01D28WX10","authors":"M.

Their fates are now completely intertwined - every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute...and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.&nbsp;</p>","title":"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes: A Hunger Games Novel","titleShort":"The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"},{"added":12,"asin":"B00F8LCAUY","authors":[{"name":"Luke Scull","url":"B00E7FSHMM"}],"blurb":"The Gods are dead.
