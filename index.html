In our reality, he works in a coffee house. In the other, he becomes a battle-scarred general leading a band of followers known as the Circle. Every time he falls asleep in one reality, he wakes in the other. The fate of both worlds now rests on his ability to shift realities through his dreams - and somehow, find a way to change history.</p> <p>Four novels. Two worlds. One story.</p> <p>Praise for the Circle series:</p> <p>“Put simply: it’s a brilliant, dangerous idea. And we need more dangerous ideas.... Dekker’s trilogy is a mythical epic, with a vast, predetermined plot and a scope of staggering proportions.... <i>Black</i> is one of those books that will make you thankful that you know how to read. If you love a good story, and don’t mind suspending a little healthy disbelief, <i>Black</i> will keep you utterly enthralled from beginning to...well, cliffhanger. <i>Red</i> can’t get here fast enough.” (FuseMagazine.net)</p> <p>“As a producer of movies filled with incredible worlds and heroic characters, I have high standards for the fiction I read. Ted Dekker’s novels deliver big with mind-blowing, plot-twisting page-turners. Fair warning - this trilogy will draw you in at a breakneck pace and never let up. Cancel all plans before you start because you won’t be able to stop once you enter <i>Black</i>.” (Ralph Winter, producer - <i>X-Men</i>,<i> X2: X-Men United</i>,<i> Planet of the Apes</i>, executive producer - <i>StarTrek V: Final Frontier</i>)</p> <p>“<i>Black</i> has to be the read of the year! A powerful, thought-provoking, edge-of-your-seat thriller of epic proportions that offers great depth and insight into the forces around us.” (Joe Goodman, film producer, Namesake Entertainment)</p>","title":"The Complete Circle Series: Black/Red/White/Green","titleShort":"The Complete Circle Series"},{"added":130,"asin":"059321630X","authors":[{"name":"Colin Jost","url":"B08157PGR9"}],"blurb":"In these hilarious essays, the Saturday Night Live head writer and Weekend Update co-anchor learns how to take a beating....","categories":[{"name":"Biographies & Memoirs","url":"18571951011"},{"name":"Entertainment & Celebrities","url":"18571984011"}],"cover":"41ZMF7TuhkL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"7h 41m","narrators":[{"name":"Colin Jost"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1797113062","authors":"Jerry Seinfeld","cover":"41QRZF66BcL","length":"6 hrs and 19 mins","narrators":"Jerry Seinfeld","title":"Is This Anything?"},{"asin":"B004RCBFII","authors":"Tina Fey","cover":"51y1DaT8pQL","length":"5 hrs and 32 mins","narrators":"Tina Fey","title":"Bossypants"},{"asin":"B007MWI0QK","authors":"Rachel Dratch","cover":"51wc5HBeMlL","length":"5 hrs and 12 mins","narrators":"Rachel Dratch","subHeading":"Comedy Calamities, Dating Disasters, and a Midlife Miracle","title":"Girl Walks into a Bar..."},{"asin":"B00MP15T12","authors":"Amy Poehler","cover":"512QYi8RoLL","length":"7 hrs and 31 mins","narrators":"Amy Poehler, Carol Burnett, Seth Meyers, and others","title":"Yes Please"},{"asin":"1721376658","authors":"Mindy Kaling","cover":"51KbRtqG7cL","length":"29 mins","narrators":"Mindy Kaling","subHeading":"Nothing Like I Imagined","title":"Please Like Me (But Keep Away)"},{"asin":"B005V2HRA8","authors":"Mindy Kaling","cover":"61Ai3R+dwLL","length":"4 hrs and 37 mins","narrators":"Mindy Kaling, Michael Schur, B.

You'll go behind the scenes at <i>SNL </i>and Weekend Update (where he's written some of the most memorable sketches and jokes of the past 15 years).

The product of a generous and humane sensibility, this timeless account makes intelligible the full span of human history for the curious of all ages, but especially children.</p> <p>Translated by Caroline Mustill.</p>","title":"A Little History of the World","titleShort":"A Little History of the World"},{"added":122,"asin":"B06WLMWF2S","authors":[{"name":"Arthur Conan Doyle","url":"B000AQ43GQ"},{"name":"Stephen Fry - introductions","url":"B000APAGVS"}],"blurb":"Audible is proud to present Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, read by Stephen Fry, a lifelong fan of Doyle's detective fiction....","categories":null,"cover":"51T1NWIkR4L","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","fromPlusCatalog":true,"language":"English","length":"62h 52m","narrators":[{"name":"Stephen Fry"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B08JZF5T49","authors":"Jane Austen","cover":"61YuwY8sM-L","length":"45 hrs","narrators":"Claire Foy, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Billie Piper, and others","subHeading":"An Audible Original Drama","title":"The Jane Austen Collection"},{"asin":"B002VA9SWS","authors":"Douglas Adams","cover":"51b09NRSkiL","length":"5 hrs and 51 mins","narrators":"Stephen Fry","title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"},{"asin":"B013HJWP1M","authors":"John Taylor","cover":"51TqvZg4yGL","length":"2 hrs and 4 mins","narrators":"Benedict Cumberbatch","subHeading":"Four Original Short Stories","title":"Benedict Cumberbatch Reads Sherlock Holmes' Rediscovered Railway Stories"},{"asin":"1787534693","authors":"Oscar Wilde","cover":"51QVE1-tTiL","length":"11 hrs and 58 mins","narrators":"Miriam Margolyes, Judi Dench, Diana Rigg, and others","subHeading":"Five Full-Cast Productions","title":"The Oscar Wilde BBC Radio Drama Collection"},{"asin":"B00M4KV2M4","authors":"Antony Jay, Jonathan Lynn","cover":"51LYflhp5jL","length":"18 hrs and 28 mins","narrators":"Paul Eddington, full cast, Nigel Hawthorn","title":"Yes Minister & Yes Prime Minister - The Complete Audio Collection"},{"asin":"B0099RKI5W","authors":"J.

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.&nbsp;</p> <p>This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?</p> <p>Other

But facing Obliteration in Babilar was too much. Once the Reckoners' leader, Prof has now embraced his Epic destiny. He's disappeared into those murky shadows of menace Epics are infamous for the world over, and everyone knows there's no turning back.... </p> <p>But everyone is wrong. Redemption is possible for Epics - Megan proved it. They're not lost. Not completely. And David is just about crazy enough to face down the most powerful High Epic of all to get his friend back. Or die trying. </p>","title":"Calamity: The Reckoners, Book 3","titleShort":"Calamity"},{"added":95,"asin":"B00O3IUEII","authors":[{"name":"Brandon Sanderson","url":"B001IGFHW6"}],"blurb":"Newcago is free.

But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100 feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. </p> <p>With horror, the narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much as corralled.</p>","title":"The War of the Worlds","titleShort":"The War of the Worlds"},{"added":46,"asin":"B017DPC65Q","authors":[{"name":"Paul Tassi","url":"B00GF2V55Q"}],"blurb":"The Earth lies in ruins in the aftermath of an extraterrestrial invasion, the land devastated by a desperate war with no winners between mankind....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51qjfMVYqZL","format":"Unabridged Audiobook","fromPlusCatalog":true,"language":"English","length":"10h 32m","narrators":[{"name":"Victor Bevine"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B01976WLBS","authors":"Paul Tassi","cover":"516nmgF80JL","length":"12 hrs and 44 mins","narrators":"Victor Bevine","subHeading":"The Earthborn Trilogy, Book 2","title":"The Exiled Earthborn"},{"asin":"B01D0L2TEA","authors":"Paul Tassi","cover":"51vUVOd3G2L","length":"16 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Victor Bevine","subHeading":"The Earthborn Trilogy, Book 3","title":"The Sons of Sora"},{"asin":"B084WZ6H1C","authors":"Nathan Hystad, Jasper T.

The seas are drying up while the atmosphere corrodes and slowly cooks any life remaining on the now desolate rock. Food is scarce, trust even more so, and the only people left alive all have done horrific things to stay that way. </p><p>Among the few survivors is Lucas, an ordinary man hardened by the last few years after the world's end. He's fought off bandits, murderers, and stranded creatures on his long trek across the country in search of his family, the one thing that drives him to outlive his dying planet.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.</p> <p>It has been centuries since the fall of the 10 consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them and won by them.</p> <p>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where 10 armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.</p> <p>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.</p> <p>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.</p> <p>The result of more than 10 years of planning, writing, and world-building, <i>The Way of Kings</i> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.</p> <p>Speak again the ancient oaths:</p> <p>Life before death.</p> <p>Strength before weakness.</p> <p>Journey before destination.</p> <p>And return to men the Shards they once bore.</p> <p>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p>The Cosmere</p> <p>The Stormlight Archive:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer (Novella)</i></li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> </ul> <p>Collection:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>","title":"The Way of Kings: The Stormlight Archive, Book 1","titleShort":"The Way of Kings"},{"added":22,"asin":"B01EQIQNYI","authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Sansbury Smith","url":"B00BVNB3TC"}],"blurb":"The worst of nature and the worst of science will bring the human race to the brink of extinction.

When a top secret medical corps research facility goes dark, Team Ghost is called in to face their deadliest enemy yet - a variant strain of Ebola that turns men into monsters. </p> <p>After barely escaping with his life, Beckham returns to Fort Bragg in the midst of a new type of war. The virus is already spreading. As cities fall, Team Ghost is ordered to keep CDC virologist Dr. Kate Lovato alive long enough to find a cure. What she uncovers will change everything. </p> <p>Total extinction is just on the horizon, but will the cure be worse than the virus? </p> <p><i>Extinction Edge</i> </p> <p>A new threat that will bring humanity to the edge of extinction. </p> <p>The dust from Dr. Kate Lovato's bioweapon has settled. Projections put death counts in the billions. Her weapon was supposed to be the endgame, but it turned a small percentage of those infected with the hemorrhage virus into something even worse. </p> <p>Survivors call them Variants. Irreversible epigenetic changes have transformed them into predators unlike any the human race has ever seen. And they are evolving. </p> <p>With the doomsday clock ticking, the fractured military plans Operation Liberty - a desperate mission designed to take back the cities and destroy the Variant threat. Master Sergeant Reed Beckham agrees to lead a strike team into New York City, but first he must return to Fort Bragg to search for the only family he has left. </p> <p>At Plum Island, Kate discovers Central Command may have considerably underestimated the Variant population in New York. As Operation Liberty draws closer, Kate warns Beckham that Team Ghost won't just face their deadliest adversary yet, they may be heading into a trap. </p> <p><i>Extinction Age</i> </p> <p>On the eve of extinction, all seems to be lost, but there is still one final hope. </p> <p>Operation Liberty has failed. Humans are losing the war. With no other option, General Kennor decides to pull back the troops and give science a second chance. </p> <p>Trapped in the extensive sewer system beneath New York, Master Sergeant Reed Beckham and the survivors of 1st Platoon must battle through the tunnels - where they make a grisly discovery in their attempt to escape. </p> <p>At Plum Island, Dr. Kate Lovato is working on a new bioweapon to destroy the Variants. But when a derelict Navy destroyer crashes into the Connecticut shoreline, she is forced to deal with a nightmare she thought had ended. </p> <p>As the doomsday clock ticks down and military bases fall across the country, the human race enters the age of extinction. </p>","title":"The Extinction Cycle Boxed Set: Extinction Horizon, Extinction Edge, and Extinction Age (The Extinction Cycle, Books 1 - 3)","titleShort":"The Extinction Cycle Boxed Set"},{"added":21,"asin":"B003T1LJ70","authors":[{"name":"Glen Cook","url":"B000AQ26ZQ"}],"blurb":"Some feel the Lady, newly risen from centuries in thrall, stands between humankind and evil.

The godly essence now residing within him offers power that could be used against the Fade - but with every death that feeds It, Cole risks losing a part of himself.

And in the frozen north, the legendary warrior Brodar Kayne fights a desperate battle for his people. He is running out of time: an ancient evil sealed beneath the mountains is about to break free, an evil that is older than humanity, older than the Fade, older even than the gods - and it will not stop until the entire world is drowned in blood. </p>","title":"Dead Man's Steel: The Grim Company, Book 3","titleShort":"Dead Man's Steel"},{"added":14,"asin":"B00XK3GO4U","authors":[{"name":"Luke Scull","url":"B00E7FSHMM"}],"blurb":"The adventure continues as the company - now broken - face new dangers on personal quests....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Fantasy","url":"18580607011"}],"cover":"51+3B5+omWL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"17h 54m ","narrators":[{"name":"Gerard Doyle"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00VUS19W4","authors":"Peter Newman","cover":"51TWxPZ-YtL","length":"13 hrs and 24 mins","narrators":"Jot Davies","title":"The Vagrant"},{"asin":"000833143X","authors":"David Wragg","cover":"61rmk7SDGnL","length":"12 hrs and 9 mins","narrators":"Colin Mace","subHeading":"Articles of Faith, Book 1","title":"The Black Hawks"},{"asin":"B01GIRIFOQ","authors":"Mark Lawrence","cover":"514owCuB0mL","length":"18 hrs and 59 mins","narrators":"Tim Gerard Reynolds","title":"The Wheel of Osheim"},{"asin":"B01D28WX10","authors":"M.
